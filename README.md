# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Analytics course at CareerFoundry and focuses on conducting an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data. Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through a mobile application. The objective of this analysis is to uncover insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Objective

As an analyst for Instacart, the goal is to perform exploratory analysis on the provided data to gain insights into sales patterns. This includes understanding customer behavior, identifying popular products, analyzing order frequency, and exploring relationships between different variables. The insights derived from this analysis will help Instacart make informed decisions and improve their sales strategies.

## Data

For this project, I'll be utilizing a combination of open-source datasets provided by Instacart. Additionally, a customer data set (created and included for the purpose of
this project). Each dataset contains various kinds of information related to Instacart's operations and customer behavior. 


## Analysis

The analysis will involve the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: This step includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting descriptive statistics, visualizations, and summary tables to understand the distribution of variables, identify trends, and explore relationships between different factors.
3. Customer Segmentation: Using clustering techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other relevant factors.
4. Insights and Recommendations: Deriving actionable insights from the analysis and providing recommendations to Instacart based on the findings.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python programming language
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- NumPy for numerical computing
- OS module for interacting with the operating system
- Excel for final report generation
